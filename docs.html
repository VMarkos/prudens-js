                    </p>
                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Suppose you own one of these robot vacuum cleaners and also suppose that you can interact with it in order to train it to behave as per your commands.
                        Now, suppose that once you charge your robot vacuum cleaner, you give it the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text">"Clean all the house every day at 7 PM!"
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, let us suppose that it is Sunday afternoon, 6:59 PM and that you are relaxing. Suddenly, you hear an annoying sound coming from the living room:
                        it is the robot vacuum cleaner that has just started cleaning. At this time you realise that you should make some adjustments to your cleaner's settings.
                        Namely, you get up, go to your living room and give the following command to your cleaner:
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text">"Do not clean the house at 7 PM on Sundays! Instead, wait for me to tell you when to start cleaning on Sundays!"
                    </p>
                    <p>In the above, you have just provided your automated cleaner with an exception, in the sense that while its general cleaning policy will be to clean every day at 7 PM,
                        on Sundays it should deviate from it and wait for your order to do so. 
                        Proceeding in this way, you may find more circumstances in which you would like your cleaner to deviate from its previous policy and temporarily
                        adopt some other behaviour.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Situations like the one described above, where a human coaches a machine in order to accomplish some certain task as per their desire are captured by 
                        <a href="https://cognition.ouc.ac.cy/loizos/papers/Michael_2019_MachineCoaching.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="text-link">Machine Coaching (MC)</span></a>.
                        In short, MC is an iterative human-machine interaction through which a human can transfer knowledge to an agent who, in turn, acts based on it and returns explanations in 
                        the forms of arguments constructed from the knowledge it has accumulated. 
                        Upon each such argument the user may provide some input in the form of some counter-argument, in order to update the agent's knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <h2>The language of Prudens</h2>
                    <p>Since MC offers a means of communication between humans and machines, it is natural that there should exist some common language through which knowledge is transferred
                        from the human end-user to the machine agent and vice-versa. In this section we will describe the syntax and semantics of this declarative language.</p>
                    <h3>Predicates, variables and constants</h3>
                    <p>At some extent, Prudens's language shares several common features with prolog. To begin with, Prudens's language allows for <em>predicates</em> to be used to 
                        denote relations between entities of the universe. Syntactically, each predicate consists of two parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>its <em>name</em>, which starts with a lower-case letter of the Latin alphabet (a-z) which may be followed by any finite sequence of letters
                                (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9) and underscores (_), and;</li>
                            <li>its <em>list of arguments</em>, which follows its name separated by no other character and consists of a comma-separated list of
                                arguments enclosed in left and right parentheses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>So, the syntactical form of a predicate is the following:</p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">name(arg1,arg2,...,argn)</span>.</p>
                    <p>
                        We will refer to the (fixed) number, <span class="code">n</span>, of arguments appearing in a predicate's arguments list as the predicate's <em>arity</em> and we 
                        will also refer to a predicate of arity n as an <em>n-ary predicate</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding a predicate's arguments, they are restricted to be either <em>constants</em> or <em>variables</em>. Constants are intended to be interpreted as specific
                        entities of our universe while variables serve as placeholders for constants. In Prudens's language, constants are represented by strings which start with a
                        lower-case letter (a-z) which may be followed by any finite sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9) and underscores (_) - exactly as with a
                        predicate's name. On the other hand, variables are represented by string which start with
                        an upper-case letter (A-Z) which may again be followed by any finite sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9) and underscores (_).
                        So, for instance, the following:
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">fatherOf(X,bob)</span></p>
                    <p>is a binary predicate symbol, <span class="code">fatherOf(&#183,&#183)</span>, with an arguments list consisting of a variable, <span class="code">X</span>,
                        and a constant, <span class="code">bob</span>. In case we interpret <span class="code">fatherOf(X,Y)</span> as "X is the father of Y"
                        and assume that there exists some entity named Bob in our universe, then the above may be interpreted as "Someone (<span class="code">X</span>) is the father
                        of Bob".</p>
                    <p>
                        The only exception to the above are two built-in predicates, namely <span class="code">?=(&#183,&#183)</span> and <span class="code">?<(&#183,&#183)</span>.
                        As their name suggests, they denote equality and inequality in terms of math constants. That is, <span class="code">?=(X,Y)</span> is
                        always interpreted as "<span class="code">X</span> equals <span class="code">Y</span>" as well as <span class="code">?<(X,Y)</span> is always interpreted as "<span class="code">X</span> is
                        less than <span class="code">Y</span>". Moreover, <span class="code">?=(&#183,&#183)</span> also serves as a
                        predicate that allows an ungrounded variable to be unified with a constant under certain circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that Prudens's language <em>does not allow for function symbols</em>, in general.
                        That is, in case one needs to express a relation such as "2 is the successor of 1" then, instead of a typical functional notation such as:
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">2 = successor(1)</span></p>
                    <p>where <span class="code">successor(&#183)</span> denotes the successor function on natural numbers, one should use a predicate-oriented notation such as:</p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">successor(2,1)</span></p>
                    <p>where <span class="code">successor(&#183,&#183)</span> is a binary predicate which is interpreted as "The first argument is the successor of the second one".</p>
                    <p>The only exception to the above occurs in the case of maths or other native Javascript functions which may be called within the scope of <span class="code">?=(&#183,&#183)</span>
                        and <span class="code">?<(&#183,&#183)</span> or any custom Javascript predicate.</p>
                    <h3>Literals, Rules, Knowledge Bases and Contexts</h3>
                    <p>Predicates, variables and constants are the building blocks with which one can construct rules that capture desired behaviours or define new relations between entities of
                        our universe. The first thing one may build with predicates is a <em>literal</em>. A literal in the context of Prudens's language is
                        either a predicate itself or a negated predicate, where negation is denoted by
                        the minus symbol (<span class="code">-</span>) preceding the predicate's name - no spaces are allowed between the predicate's name and the negation symbol.
                        So, for instance, the following are both literals:</p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">fatherOf(X,bob), -fatherOf(Y,alice)</span></p>
                    <p>At this point we should highlight that negation within the context of Prudens's language is treated as <em>classical negation</em> which is not what
                        happens e.g. with prolog. To shed more light on this subtle difference let us consider the following two literals:</p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">fatherOf(george,bob); fatherOf(alice,george);</span></p>
                    <p>Under the Closed World Assumption (CWA) - i.e. by treating negation as failure - we can infer from the above
                        that <span class="code">-fatherOf(george,jim)</span> since the literal <span class="code">fatherOf(george,jim)</span> is not included in our knowledge and,
                        due to the CWA, it is not true. However, in the setting of Prudens's language,
                        we cannot infer from the above that <span class="code">-fatherOf(george,jim)</span>, since we have not accepted any form of CWA.</p>
                    <p>Having clarified the status of negation in the context of Prudens's language, we proceed with rules. Rules in the context of Prudens's language consist of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <em>name</em>, which is separated by <span class="code">::</span> from the rule's main part;</li>
                        <li>a <em>body</em>, which is a comma-separated list of literals and;</li>
                        <li>a <em>head</em>, which is a single literal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For instance, the following string is a rule:</p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">Rule_1 :: fatherOf(X, Y), fatherOf(X, Z) implies siblings(Y, Z)</span>.</p>
                    <p>It is important to note at this point that all three attributes of a rule - i.e. its name, its body and its head - should not be empty. So, a rule cannot be 
                        nameless, and one may not infer anything having no hypotheses.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using rules, one may construct knowledge bases, which are order lists of rules. For instance, the following list of two rules is considered a knowledge base:</p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">Rule_1 :: f(X), g(X, Y) implies h(X);<br>Rule_2 :: f(X) implies -h(X);</div></div>
                    <p>The same applies for the following one:</p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">Rule_2 :: f(X) implies -h(X);<br>Rule_1 :: f(X), g(X, Y) implies h(X);</div></div>
                    <p>Observe that, as we have mentioned above, knowledge bases are <em>ordered</em> lists of rules. So, the above two knowledge bases are different. For more on
                    how the order of rules affects inference, see the <a href="#Inference"><span class="text-link">corresponding section</span></a>.</p>
                    <p>As one may observe, knowledge bases encode knowledge in the form of prioritized if-then rules. Another structure that encodes knowledge within Prudens's language
                        are <em>contexts</em>. A context is a set of pairwise non-conflicting variable-free literals. That is, any literal that is included in a context has all its variables substituted with
                        some constants. So, while e.g. <span class="code">f(a,b)</span> may be included in some context, <span class="code">f(X,b)</span> may not be part of any
                        context, due to <span class="code">X</span> being not substituted with some constant. So, an example of a context is the following one:
                    </p>
                    <p class="center-text"><span class="code">f(a); f(b); g(a, b); h(a, b, c);</span></p>
                    <p>Observe that, as with knowledge bases, the different entries of a context are separated from each other with a semicolon (<span class="code">;</span>).</p>
                    <h2>Inference</h2>
                    <p>As we have mentioned above, Prudens's language allows for two separate structures to encode knowledge:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge bases, which are ordered collections of rules and;</li>
                        <li>contexts, which ara (unordered) lists of instantiated and pairwise non-conflicting literals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As far as the first are concerned, knowledge bases are intended to represent knowledge in the form of general rules that describe some certain behaviour
                        <em>across several possible situations.</em> On the other hand, contexts encode knowledge in the form of <em>facts</em> describing a <em>specific situation</em>.
                        So, within the context of Prudens's language, contexts contain <em>idisputable facts</em> that hold at some certain occasion while a knowledge base contains 
                        <em>general rules</em> that are triggered by a contextual facts.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Rules and Priorities</h3>
                    <p>To clarify things a little more, consider the following knowledge base, let KB1:</p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">Rule_3 :: isSunday(X), isRaining(X) implies action(atHome);<br>Rule_2 :: isSunday(X), isRaining(X) implies -action(playOutside);<br>
                        Rule_1 :: isSunday(X) implies action(playOutside);</div></div>
                    <p>KB1 encodes a simple policy regarding what to do (or not to do) on Sundays. Namely, <span class="code">Rule_1</span> informs us that we are willing to go and play
                    outside on Sundays. However, <span class="code">Rule_2</span> adds an exception to the above general behaviour. Namely, on rainy Sundays, we are not willing to
                    play outside but, instead, as <span class="code">Rule_3</span> informs us, we prefer staying at home. So, KB1 encodes our behaviour across two possible scenarios:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>on a casual sunny Sunday we prefer to play outside but;</li>
                        <li>on a rainy Sunday we prefer staying at home.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The two above scenarios can be encoded using two contexts, namely, context C1:</p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">isSunday(today)</div></div>
                    <p>which encodes the first scenario - a casual (non-rainy) Sunday and context C2:</p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">isSunday(today); isRaining(today);</div></div>
                    <p>which encodes the second scenario - a rainy Sunday.</p>
                    <p>Observe in the above how the order of the rules plays an important role. As we have said, a knowledge base is an <em>ordered</em> list of rules. The order of appearance
                    of rules in a knowledge base determines what happens when two conflicting rules have been triggered at the same time. Namely, in the above case where under C2 both
                    <span class="code">Rule_1</span> and <span class="code">Rule_2</span> are triggered, since <span class="code">Rule_2</span> appears higher than
                    <span class="code">Rule_1</span> in KB1, we infer that <span class="code">Rule_2</span> is <em>of higher priority</em> than <span class="code">Rule_1</span> and,
                    hence, we ignore the latter in favour of <span class="code">Rule_2</span>.</p>
                    <p>
                        In case we had the following knowledge base, let KB2, instead of KB1, things would be different:
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-container"><div class="code-block">Rule_1 :: isSunday(X) implies action(playOutside);<br>

                        outside and play - since rules <span class="code">Rule_2</span> and <span class="code">Rule_3</span> are either not triggered - in C1 - or triggered but dismissed due to
                        being of lower priority than <span class="code">Rule_1</span> - in C2.</p>

                            <li>#003: Custom Javascript predicates as well as <span class="code">?=</span> and <span class="code">?<</span> predicates are not fully supported yet.</li>
                            <li>#004: Syntax highlighting is not fully supported yet in none of the two editors.</li>
                            <li>#005: Syntax error codes regarding Prudens's language are still under development. Thus, all errors as for now fall into the same category - namely,

                            <li>#006: Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut does not work properly - neither does the Right click > Undo/Redo functionality in both "Knowledge Base" and "Context"

                            <li>#008: When <span class="code">?=</span> is used as the first (or single) predicate in a rule's body, reasoning yields unpredictable results - however, when used at a later position in a rule, it works as expected.</li>
