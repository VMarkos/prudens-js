                    <h3>v. 0.8.0</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Bug fixes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Propositional abduction is now supported by Prudens JS.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Extensive Documentation regarding the package available <a href="https://github.com/VMarkos/prudens-js/blob/main/README.md"><span class="text-link">here</span></a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>v. 0.7.4</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prudens's language supports the equality predicate <span class="code">?=</span> which takes two arguments and checks whether 
                            they are equal or not. The arguments may be either constants or variables or Javascript mathematical expressions - or any other 
                            expressions that make sense to be compared such as, but not restricted to, strings. Also, the <span class="code">?=</span> predicate 
                            allows for a variable to be unified with another variable/constant in case the former is not already assigned.
                        </li>
                        <li>Prudens's language supports an inequality predicate, namely <span class="code">?<</span> as well which compares - inheriting any
                            underlying Javascript semantics - two expressions - be it variables, constant or, in general, valid Javascript expressions.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>v. 0.7.3</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Now the engine allows for propositional rules - i.e. rules whose literals may not include any argument. Note that a rule from 
                            this version on may contain any combination of propositional and first-order literals.
                        </li>
                        <li>The special propositional literal <span class="code">true</span> is assumed to be part of any context. This literal is assumed to 
                            be always true and may be used as a casual literal in any rule's body.
                        </li>
                        <li>The background reasoning algorithm has been slightly altered in order to speed-up computations in the case of propositional literals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>v. 0.7.2</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extended Prudens's language with a dummy variable symbol, <span class="code">_</span>, which is inteded to be used in cases when the value of the variable of
                            a predicate is of no importance.</li>
                        <li>Added an abduction tab on the left of Prudens JS home page. For the time being, there is no functionality available - to be added with new update.</li>
                        <li>Added a "Download output" option over the console which, when checked, downloads the output of the console as a <span class="code">.txt</span> file.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>v. 0.7.1</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fixed Bug #001 - Ctrl+A keyboard shortcut now selects all text in the corresponding code editor.</li>
                        <li>Now apart from any inferences that may occur during deduction, the corresponding inference graph is presented in the console, below the inferences themselves.
                            Actually, what is presented is a mapping from any non-contextual inferred literals alongside a list of rules that has led to them being inferred during the
                            inference process.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>v. 0.7.0</h2> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>All Prudens's basic functionalities are supported. For more, see <a href="docs.html"><span class="text-link">Documentation</span></a>.</li>
                        <li>Code within both "Knowledge Base" and "Context" editors is checked for any syntax errors. However, the error messages returned in the console are
                            still at an early stage and, hence, quite generic.
                        </li>
                        <li>All the relevant output - i.e. inferences, errors or warnings - are printed in the console. The only thing that is not yet printed are the corresponding
                            explanations - they will be part of possibly the next update.</li>
                        <li>The only way to interact with the console other than using the "Deduce!" buttpn is by pressing the "Clear" button - above the console's top right corner -
                            which clear's anything that appears in it.
                        </li>
